# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos A. Mignone

### Data Engineer | Backend Developer

I am a Data Engineer and Backend Developer focused on building reliable, scalable systems that transform data into usable and valuable assets.  
My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and data engineering, with a strong emphasis on automation, data quality, and system reliability.

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I design and build data-driven systems thinking end-to-end:  
from data ingestion and processing to storage, exposure through APIs, and final consumption by analytics or business tools.

I am particularly interested in environments where:
- Data is treated as a product.
- Engineering decisions consider scalability, maintainability, and operational impact.
- Backend services and data pipelines work together as part of the same ecosystem.

---

## 🛠️ What I Do

- Design and develop **data pipelines (ETL / ELT)** from multiple sources.
- Build and maintain **backend services and REST APIs**.
- Model relational and NoSQL databases to support analytical and operational use cases.
- Implement **orchestration and automation** for data workflows.
- Ensure data quality, observability, and reproducibility across systems.

## 💻 Technologies & Tools

### Languages
- **Python** (data processing, scripting, backend services)
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** (backend development, APIs)

### Data & Backend
- **REST APIs**
- **Apache Airflow** (orchestration)
- **Apache Kafka** (event streaming)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MongoDB**

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **AWS** (data and compute services)
- **Docker** (containerized, reproducible environments)

### Engineering Practices
- Version control with **Git / GitHub**
- Modular and maintainable system design
- Documentation and reproducibility
- Agile workflows
