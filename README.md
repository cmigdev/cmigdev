# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos A. Mignone

### Backend & Fullstack Developer | Data Engineering Focus

Backend and Fullstack Developer with professional experience building production-ready APIs, services, and web applications.  
Currently transitioning towards **Data Engineering**, working on data pipelines, workflow orchestration, and distributed systems.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I design and build systems with an end-to-end mindset, combining backend engineering with data-driven architectures.  
My work spans from data ingestion and processing to storage, exposure through APIs, and final consumption by analytics or business tools.

My professional background is primarily in backend and fullstack development, where I have designed and implemented scalable services, APIs, and system integrations.

I am particularly interested in environments where:
- Data is treated as a product, with clear ownership and quality standards
- Engineering decisions consider scalability, maintainability, and operational impact
- Backend services and data pipelines work together as part of the same ecosystem
